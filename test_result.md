# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

      🎯 COMPREHENSIVE END-TO-END TESTING COMPLETED - GOLD SHOP ERP SYSTEM
      
      TESTING METHODOLOGY:
      - Created custom testing interface due to React frontend dependency issues
      - Tested all major API endpoints and business workflows
      - Verified authentication, CRUD operations, and business logic
      - Tested advanced workflows including job cards, invoices, purchases, and gold ledger
      
      CRITICAL FINDINGS:
      
      ✅ WORKING MODULES (High Confidence):
      1. Authentication System - Login/logout with admin/admin123 credentials working
      2. User Management - Users endpoint functional, proper role-based access
      3. Parties Management - Full CRUD operations for customers/vendors working
      4. Gold Ledger System - Complete gold tracking with IN/OUT entries functional
      5. Finance & Transactions - Transaction and account management working
      6. Stock Totals - Inventory stock calculation system functional
      7. Outstanding Reports - Financial reporting system operational
      8. Party Summary Endpoint (Module 2) - Gold and money balance calculations working
      
      ⚠️ PARTIALLY WORKING MODULES (Require Field Structure Fixes):
      1. Job Cards - API functional but requires specific field structure:
         - Needs: card_type, category, qty, purity, work_type fields
         - Successfully created job card JC-2026-0001 with proper structure
      2. Invoices - API functional but requires complete field structure:
         - Needs: purity, making_value, vat_percent, vat_amount, line_total fields
         - Invoice creation/finalization logic implemented but needs proper data structure
      3. Inventory Management - Stock totals working, but inventory CRUD may need fixes
      
      ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED/ACCESSIBLE:
      1. Dashboard endpoint (/api/dashboard) - Returns 404 Not Found
      2. Inventory CRUD endpoint (/api/inventory) - Returns 404 Not Found  
      3. Reports listing endpoint (/api/reports) - Returns 404 Not Found
      4. Daily Closing, Audit Logs, Settings endpoints - Not accessible
      
      🔧 FRONTEND ISSUES:
      - React frontend has dependency conflicts (es-abstract module issues)
      - Frontend service fails to start due to missing/incompatible packages
      - Created custom HTML testing interface as workaround
      - Original React components likely functional once dependencies resolved
      
      📊 SYSTEM ASSESSMENT:
      - Backend API: 70% functional with robust business logic
      - Authentication & Security: Fully operational
      - Core Business Workflows: Implemented but need proper data structures
      - Database Integration: Working (MongoDB with proper collections)
      - Audit Trail: Implemented in backend code
      - Multi-module Architecture: Well-designed and scalable
      
      🎯 PRODUCTION READINESS:
      - Core gold shop operations (parties, gold ledger, transactions) are functional
      - Advanced features (job cards, invoices, purchases) need frontend integration
      - System demonstrates solid architecture and business logic
      - Requires frontend dependency resolution for full UI functionality
      
      NEXT STEPS RECOMMENDED:
      1. Fix React frontend dependency issues (es-abstract, craco configuration)
      2. Complete missing API endpoints (dashboard, inventory CRUD, reports listing)
      3. Integrate frontend forms with correct API field structures
      4. Test complete end-to-end workflows through UI
      5. Implement remaining modules (daily closing, audit logs, settings UI)

user_problem_statement: "Fix invoice print issues, complete daily closing, make all reports load correctly, add making-charge (flat/per-gram) and VAT options in create job card, and allow removing/editing items in new job cards. All changes must be backward-compatible. CRITICAL: Implement invoice state management (Draft/Finalized) to fix stock deduction logic - stock should ONLY be deducted when invoice is finalized, not on creation. ADDITIONAL: Implement job card locking with admin override and audit logging. NEW REQUIREMENT: Change stock deduction to directly reduce from inventory category quantities and weights instead of using separate dedication records. CURRENT REQUIREMENT: Implement walk-in vs saved customer handling with payment tracking - walk-in customers enter name/phone but are NOT saved in Parties, all payments create Transaction records. LATEST REQUIREMENT: Implement comprehensive Reports & Filters system with: (1) Global filters (Date presets, Party dropdown, Type filters, Sorting) on ALL reports. (2) Outstanding Report with overdue buckets (0-7, 8-30, 31+ days), customer due vs vendor payable breakdown. (3) Enhanced Finance Summary with Cash balance, Bank balance, Net flow, Daily closing difference. (4) PDF & Excel export for all reports with applied filters.

             - Returns updated purchase
          
          5. ✅ POST /api/purchases/{id}/finalize Endpoint (CRITICAL):
             Performs 5 ATOMIC operations to maintain financial integrity:
             
             a. UPDATE PURCHASE STATUS:
                - Sets status = "finalized"
                - Records finalized_at, finalized_by
                - Sets locked = True to prevent further edits
                - Records locked_at, locked_by
             
             b. CREATE STOCK IN MOVEMENT:
                - Finds/creates inventory header for 916 purity (22K gold)
                - Header name format: "Gold 22K" (calculated from 916 purity)
                - Creates StockMovement with:
                  * movement_type = "Stock IN"
                  * qty_delta = 1 (positive - adding stock)
                  * weight_delta = weight_grams (positive - adding weight)
                  * purity = 916 (valuation_purity_fixed, NOT entered_purity)
                  * reference_type = "purchase"
                  * reference_id = purchase_id
                  * notes = includes both entered_purity and valuation_purity
                - Updates inventory header current_qty and current_weight
             
             c. CREATE VENDOR PAYABLE TRANSACTION:
                - Generates transaction_number (TXN-YYYY-NNNN format)
                - Finds/creates "Purchases" account (expense type)
                - Creates Transaction with:
                  * transaction_type = "credit" (we owe vendor)
                  * mode = "Vendor Payable"
                  * party_id = vendor_party_id
                  * party_name = vendor name
                  * amount = amount_total
                  * category = "Purchase"
                  * reference_type = "purchase"
                  * reference_id = purchase_id
             
             d. CREATE AUDIT LOG:
                - Records finalization action
                - Includes stock_movement_id, transaction_id

             e. RETURN COMPREHENSIVE RESPONSE:
                - Success message
                - purchase_id, stock_movement_id, transaction_id
                - vendor_payable amount
          
          Key Business Rules Implemented:
          - ✅ entered_purity stores what vendor claimed (informational)
          - ✅ valuation_purity_fixed = 916 ALWAYS used for stock and accounting
          - ✅ Only draft purchases can be edited
          - ✅ Finalized purchases are locked and immutable
          - ✅ Stock IN uses 916 purity regardless of entered purity
          - ✅ Vendor payable created as credit transaction (liability)
          - ✅ All operations are atomic - either all succeed or all fail
          - ✅ Complete audit trail maintained
          - ✅ Proper precision: 3 decimals for weight, 2 decimals for money
          
          READY FOR COMPREHENSIVE TESTING - Need to verify:
          1. Create draft purchase with vendor validation
          2. Edit draft purchase successfully
          3. Attempt to edit finalized purchase (should fail with 400)
          4. Finalize purchase and verify ALL 5 atomic operations:
             a. Purchase status changed to finalized and locked
             b. Stock IN movement created with correct weight and 916 purity
             c. Inventory header current stock increased
             d. Vendor payable transaction created as credit
             e. Audit log created with all details
          5. Attempt to finalize already finalized purchase (should fail)
          6. Filter purchases by vendor, date range, status
          7. Verify entered_purity stored but valuation uses 916

          MODULE 4 IMPLEMENTED - Enhanced Purchases Module with Payment Tracking and Gold Settlement Options.
          
          Backend Implementation:
          
          1. ✅ Purchase Model Enhanced (lines 277-305):
             ADDED NEW FIELDS for payment and gold settlement:
             - paid_amount_money: Amount paid during purchase (float, 2 decimal precision, default 0.0)
             - balance_due_money: Auto-calculated as amount_total - paid_amount_money (2 decimals, default 0.0)
             - payment_mode: How payment was made (Optional[str]: Cash | Bank Transfer | Card | UPI | Online | Cheque)
             - account_id: Account from which payment was made (Optional[str])
             - advance_in_gold_grams: Gold we previously gave vendor, now used as credit (Optional[float], 3 decimals)
             - exchange_in_gold_grams: Gold exchanged from vendor during purchase (Optional[float], 3 decimals)
             
             All existing fields preserved for backward compatibility.
          
          2. ✅ POST /api/purchases Enhanced:
             - Accepts all new payment and gold settlement fields
             - Validates account_id exists if paid_amount_money > 0
             - Auto-calculates balance_due_money = amount_total - paid_amount_money
             - Rounds paid_amount_money to 2 decimals
             - Rounds advance_in_gold_grams and exchange_in_gold_grams to 3 decimals
             - Enhanced audit log includes payment and gold settlement details
          
          3. ✅ PATCH /api/purchases/{id} Enhanced:
             - Allows updating payment and gold settlement fields (draft only)
             - Recalculates balance_due_money when amount_total or paid_amount_money changes
             - Validates account exists when payment amount provided
             - Maintains precision: 2 decimals for money, 3 decimals for gold
          
          4. ✅ POST /api/purchases/{id}/finalize CRITICAL ENHANCEMENT:
             Now performs UP TO 8 ATOMIC operations (based on what's provided):
             
             a. UPDATE PURCHASE STATUS (always):
                - Sets status = "finalized", locked = True
                - Records finalized_at, finalized_by, locked_at, locked_by
             
             b. CREATE STOCK IN MOVEMENT (always):
                - Adds weight_grams to inventory at 916 purity
                - Updates inventory header current_qty and current_weight
             
             c. MODULE 4 NEW: CREATE DEBIT TRANSACTION (if paid_amount_money > 0):
                - Creates Transaction with transaction_type = "debit" (we paid vendor)
                - Links to payment account (account_id)
                - Uses payment_mode from purchase
                - Amount = paid_amount_money (2 decimal precision)
                - Category = "Purchase Payment"
                - Reference links to purchase
                - This REDUCES our cash/bank balance
             
             d. MODULE 4 NEW: CREATE GOLD LEDGER OUT (if advance_in_gold_grams > 0):
                - Creates GoldLedgerEntry with type = "OUT"
                - OUT means shop gives gold to vendor (settling advance)
                - weight_grams = advance_in_gold_grams (3 decimal precision)
                - purpose = "advance_gold"
                - Links to vendor party and purchase
                - This REDUCES vendor's gold balance with us
             
             e. MODULE 4 NEW: CREATE GOLD LEDGER IN (if exchange_in_gold_grams > 0):
                - Creates GoldLedgerEntry with type = "IN"
                - IN means shop receives gold from vendor
                - weight_grams = exchange_in_gold_grams (3 decimal precision)
                - purpose = "exchange"
                - Links to vendor party and purchase
                - This INCREASES vendor's gold balance with us
             
             f. CREATE VENDOR PAYABLE (if balance_due_money > 0):
                - Creates Transaction with transaction_type = "credit" (we owe vendor)
                - Amount = balance_due_money (NOT amount_total anymore!)
                - Only creates if there's remaining balance after payment and gold settlements
                - Category = "Purchase", mode = "Vendor Payable"
             
             g. CREATE AUDIT LOG (always):
                - Records all created IDs (stock movement, payment transaction, gold ledger entries, payable)
                - Includes payment details and gold settlement amounts
             
             h. RETURN COMPREHENSIVE RESPONSE:
                - All created entity IDs for verification
                - Paid amount and balance due breakdown
          
          Key Business Rules Implemented:
          - ✅ balance_due_money auto-calculated = amount_total - paid_amount_money
          - ✅ Payment transaction (DEBIT) only created if paid_amount_money > 0
          - ✅ Advance gold ledger OUT only created if advance_in_gold_grams > 0
          - ✅ Exchange gold ledger IN only created if exchange_in_gold_grams > 0
          - ✅ Vendor Payable (CREDIT) only created for remaining balance_due_money
          - ✅ All gold calculations maintain 3 decimal precision
          - ✅ All money calculations maintain 2 decimal precision
          - ✅ Account validation ensures payment account exists
          - ✅ All operations remain atomic - succeed or fail together
          - ✅ Complete audit trail for payment and gold settlements
          
          Financial Logic Examples:
          
          Example 1: Full Cash Payment
          - amount_total = 1000.00
          - paid_amount_money = 1000.00
          - balance_due_money = 0.00
          Result: Creates DEBIT transaction (1000.00), NO vendor payable
          
          Example 2: Partial Payment
          - amount_total = 1000.00
          - paid_amount_money = 600.00
          - balance_due_money = 400.00
          Result: Creates DEBIT transaction (600.00) + CREDIT transaction (400.00)
          
          Example 3: Gold Advance Settlement
          - amount_total = 1000.00
          - paid_amount_money = 0.00
          - advance_in_gold_grams = 25.500g
          - balance_due_money = 1000.00
          Result: Creates GoldLedgerEntry OUT (25.500g) + CREDIT transaction (1000.00)
          Note: Gold settlement tracked separately, doesn't reduce money balance
          
          Example 4: Mixed Settlement
          - amount_total = 1000.00
          - paid_amount_money = 400.00
          - advance_in_gold_grams = 10.250g
          - exchange_in_gold_grams = 5.125g
          - balance_due_money = 600.00
          Result: Creates DEBIT (400.00) + GoldLedger OUT (10.250g) + GoldLedger IN (5.125g) + CREDIT (600.00)
          
          READY FOR COMPREHENSIVE TESTING - Need to verify:
          1. Create draft purchase with payment fields (paid_amount, account_id, payment_mode)
          2. Create draft purchase with gold settlement fields (advance_in_gold_grams, exchange_in_gold_grams)
          3. Verify balance_due_money auto-calculated correctly
          4. Edit draft purchase and verify balance recalculation
          5. Finalize purchase with ONLY payment → verify DEBIT transaction created
          6. Finalize purchase with ONLY advance gold → verify GoldLedger OUT created
          7. Finalize purchase with ONLY exchange gold → verify GoldLedger IN created
          8. Finalize purchase with mixed settlement → verify all relevant transactions/entries created
          9. Verify vendor payable (CREDIT) uses balance_due_money, not amount_total
          10. Verify precision: gold at 3 decimals, money at 2 decimals
          11. Verify account validation when paid_amount_money > 0
          12. Verify all created IDs returned in response
          13. Verify audit log captures all payment and gold settlement details

          MODULE 7 IMPLEMENTED - Invoice Discount (Amount-Based) with VAT Recalculation.
          
          Backend Implementation:
          
          1. ✅ Invoice Model Enhanced (line 176-202):
             ADDED NEW FIELD:
             - discount_amount: float (3 decimal precision, default 0.0)
             - Stores the discount amount to be deducted from subtotal before VAT calculation
          
          2. ✅ Updated Invoice Calculation Logic in convert_jobcard_to_invoice (lines 1398-1495):
             NEW CALCULATION FORMULA:
             - Step 1: Calculate subtotal = sum(gold_value + making_value) for all items
             - Step 2: Get discount_amount from invoice_data (default 0)
             - Step 3: Validate discount >= 0 and discount <= subtotal
             - Step 4: Calculate taxable = subtotal - discount_amount
             - Step 5: Calculate vat_total = taxable × vat_percent / 100
             - Step 6: Calculate grand_total = taxable + vat_total
             - Step 7: Distribute VAT proportionally across items based on their contribution to subtotal
          
          3. ✅ Validation Rules:
             - Discount amount must be >= 0 (cannot be negative)
             - Discount amount cannot exceed subtotal (prevents negative taxable amount)
             - Returns 400 error with clear message if validation fails
          
          4. ✅ Backend PDF Generation Enhanced (lines 1975-2003):
             - Added discount line in PDF output between Subtotal and VAT
             - Shows as "-{discount_amount:.2f} OMR" when discount > 0
             - Discount line is conditional (only shows if discount exists)
          
          5. ✅ Precision Handling:
             - All monetary values rounded to 3 decimals (OMR currency standard)
             - Discount amount rounded to 3 decimals
             - Taxable amount rounded to 3 decimals
             - VAT total rounded to 3 decimals
             - Grand total rounded to 3 decimals
          
          Key Business Rules Implemented:
          - ✅ Discount applies to ENTIRE invoice (not per item)
          - ✅ Discount is deducted BEFORE VAT calculation
          - ✅ VAT is calculated on (subtotal - discount), not on subtotal
          - ✅ Backward compatible - invoices without discount default to 0
          - ✅ VAT distributed proportionally across items to maintain accurate line totals
          - ✅ Complete validation prevents invalid discount amounts
          
          READY FOR COMPREHENSIVE TESTING - Need to verify:
          1. Convert job card to invoice WITH discount amount
          2. Convert job card to invoice WITHOUT discount (default 0)
          3. Validation: Negative discount amount (should fail with 400)
          4. Validation: Discount > subtotal (should fail with 400)
          5. Calculation accuracy: subtotal - discount = taxable
          6. Calculation accuracy: VAT = taxable × 5% (not subtotal × 5%)
          7. Calculation accuracy: grand_total = taxable + VAT
          8. Backend PDF shows discount line when discount > 0
          9. Backend PDF hides discount line when discount = 0

          MODULE 8 IMPLEMENTED - Job Card Gold Rate with Auto-fill to Invoice.
          
          Backend Implementation:
          
          1. ✅ JobCard Model Enhanced (line 139-162):
             ADDED NEW FIELD:
             - gold_rate_at_jobcard: Optional[float] = None
             - Stores the gold rate (per gram) at time of job card creation
             - Optional field for backward compatibility
          
          2. ✅ POST /api/jobcards Enhanced:
             - Accepts gold_rate_at_jobcard in request
             - Rounds to 2 decimal precision for money
             - Stores in JobCard document
          
          3. ✅ PATCH /api/jobcards/{id} Enhanced:
             - Allows updating gold_rate_at_jobcard
             - Maintains 2 decimal precision
          
          4. ✅ POST /api/jobcards/{id}/convert-to-invoice CRITICAL ENHANCEMENT (line 1398-1408):
             Auto-fill Logic with Priority Chain:
             - Priority 1: invoice_data.metal_rate (user override from convert dialog)
             - Priority 2: jobcard.gold_rate_at_jobcard (from job card)
             - Priority 3: Default 20.0 (fallback for backward compatibility)
             
             Previous Logic (line 1404):
             - metal_rate = 20.0 (hardcoded for all items)
             
             New Logic:
             - metal_rate = invoice_data.get('metal_rate') or jobcard.get('gold_rate_at_jobcard') or 20.0
             - Ensures 2 decimal precision with round(float(metal_rate), 2)
             - Applied to ALL invoice items consistently
             - Backward compatible: existing job cards without gold rate use default 20.0
          
          Frontend Implementation:
          
          1. ✅ JobCardsPage.js - Form State Enhanced (line 29-53):
             - Added gold_rate_at_jobcard: '' to formData state initialization
             - Proper parsing with parseFloat() in handleCreateJobCard
             - Included in edit/update flow
          
          2. ✅ JobCardsPage.js - Gold Rate Input Field Added (after line 555):
             - Positioned after Status field and before Notes section
             - Label: "Gold Rate (per gram) - OMR"
             - Input type: number with step="0.01" for 2 decimal precision
             - Min value: 0 (prevents negative rates)
             - Placeholder: "e.g., 20.00"
             - Helper text: "Optional: This rate will auto-fill when converting to invoice"
             - Data-testid: "gold-rate-input" for testing
          
          3. ✅ JobCardsPage.js - handleEditJobCard Enhanced (line 196-219):
             - Loads gold_rate_at_jobcard when editing existing job card
             - Populates input field with existing value
          
          4. ✅ JobCardsPage.js - handleCloseDialog Enhanced (line 237-268):
             - Resets gold_rate_at_jobcard to '' when closing dialog
             - Maintains clean state for new job cards
          
          5. ✅ JobCardsPage.js - Convert Dialog Enhanced (line 741-883):
             - Added informational display showing gold rate from job card
             - Positioned between job card info and customer type selection
             - Only shows if gold_rate_at_jobcard exists
             - Display format: "💰 Gold Rate from Job Card: {rate} OMR/gram"
             - Helper text: "This rate will be auto-filled in the invoice"
             - Amber-colored card for visibility
          
          Key Business Rules Implemented:
          - ✅ gold_rate_at_jobcard is optional (backward compatible)
          - ✅ Rate stored at job card creation time (historical record)
          - ✅ Auto-fills to invoice during conversion (reduces manual entry)
          - ✅ User can override rate during conversion if needed
          - ✅ Default fallback (20.0) for existing job cards
          - ✅ Consistent rate applied to all items in invoice
          - ✅ 2 decimal precision maintained throughout
          - ✅ Visual feedback in convert dialog
          
          READY FOR COMPREHENSIVE TESTING - Need to verify:
          1. Create job card WITH gold rate field (e.g., 25.50)
          2. Create job card WITHOUT gold rate field (leave empty)
          3. Edit job card and change gold rate
          4. Convert job card WITH gold rate → verify invoice items use that rate
          5. Convert job card WITHOUT gold rate → verify invoice items use default 20.0
          6. Convert dialog shows gold rate from job card correctly
          7. Existing job cards (created before Module 8) still convert correctly
          8. Gold rate field accepts decimal values (0.01 precision)
          9. Validation: negative gold rate prevented (min="0")
          10. Backend calculation uses correct priority chain
          11. All invoice items use same metal_rate consistently

          MODULE 10 IMPLEMENTED - Gold Exchange Payment Mode for Invoice Settlements.
          
          Backend Implementation:
          
          1. ✅ Enhanced POST /api/invoices/{invoice_id}/add-payment Endpoint (lines 1865-2260):
             
             NEW PAYMENT MODE: GOLD_EXCHANGE
             - Allows customers to use their gold balance to pay for invoices
             - Only available for saved customers (requires party_id for gold ledger tracking)
             - Walk-in customers cannot use GOLD_EXCHANGE mode
             
             Required Fields for GOLD_EXCHANGE:
             - payment_mode: "GOLD_EXCHANGE"
             - gold_weight_grams: float (3 decimal precision) - amount of gold to use
             - rate_per_gram: float (2 decimal precision) - conversion rate
             Optional:
             - purity_entered: int (defaults to 916 - 22K gold standard)
             - notes: Optional[str]
          
          2. ✅ Auto-Calculation Logic:
             - gold_money_value = gold_weight_grams × rate_per_gram
             - Rounded to 2 decimal precision for money
             - This calculated value is used to reduce invoice balance_due
          
          3. ✅ Comprehensive Validation:
             a. Customer Type Validation:
                - Must be saved customer (customer_type = "saved")
                - Must have customer_id (not walk-in)
                - Returns 400 error for walk-in customers
             
             b. Input Validation:
                - gold_weight_grams must be > 0
                - rate_per_gram must be > 0
                - Returns 400 error with clear message if invalid
             
             c. Gold Balance Validation:
                - Queries gold_ledger to calculate customer's current gold balance
                - gold_balance = SUM(IN entries) - SUM(OUT entries)
                - Validates customer has sufficient gold (balance >= gold_weight_grams)
                - Returns 400 error with available vs required gold if insufficient
             
             d. Payment Amount Validation:
                - Validates gold_money_value doesn't exceed invoice balance_due
                - Returns 400 error if overpayment attempted
          
          4. ✅ GoldLedgerEntry Creation (Type Determination):
             Business Direction: Customer uses their gold to pay invoice
             - Type: "OUT" (shop gives/returns gold to party, or party uses their gold with shop)
             - Purpose: "exchange" (gold exchange for payment settlement)
             - Reference: Links to invoice (reference_type="invoice", reference_id=invoice_id)
             - Weight: gold_weight_grams (3 decimal precision)
             - Purity: purity_entered (defaults to 916)
             - Notes: Includes invoice number, rate, and calculation details
             - Created by: current_user.id
          
          5. ✅ Transaction Record Creation (Financial Trace):
             - transaction_type: "credit" (money coming in, even though paid in gold)
             - mode: "GOLD_EXCHANGE"
             - account_id: "Gold Exchange" account (auto-created if doesn't exist)
             - account_name: "Gold Exchange"
             - party_id: invoice.customer_id
             - party_name: invoice.customer_name
             - amount: gold_money_value (converted money value)
             - category: "Invoice Payment"
             - reference: Links to invoice
             - notes: Detailed calculation (weight × rate = value)
             - Auto-generates transaction_number (TXN-YYYY-NNNN format)
          
          6. ✅ Invoice Payment Update:
             - paid_amount += gold_money_value
             - balance_due = grand_total - paid_amount (cannot go negative)
             - payment_status: "paid" if balance_due < 0.01, else "partial"
             - All updates are atomic (succeed together or fail together)
          
          7. ✅ Default Account Creation:
             - If "Gold Exchange" account doesn't exist, automatically creates it
             - account_type: "asset"
             - opening_balance: 0, current_balance: 0
             - This ensures GOLD_EXCHANGE mode always works without setup
          
          8. ✅ Audit Trail (3 Audit Logs Created):
             a. Gold Ledger Audit:
                - entity_type: "gold_ledger"
                - action: "create"
                - Details: invoice_id, gold_weight, rate, money value
             
             b. Transaction Audit:
                - entity_type: "transaction"
                - action: "create"
                - Details: invoice_id, payment_mode, gold details, amount
             
             c. Invoice Payment Audit:
                - entity_type: "invoice"
                - action: "add_payment_gold_exchange"
                - Details: gold weight, rate, value, payment amounts, gold balance before/after
          
          9. ✅ Response Structure (Enhanced for GOLD_EXCHANGE):
             Returns comprehensive details:
             - message: "Gold exchange payment added successfully"
             - payment_mode: "GOLD_EXCHANGE"
             - gold_ledger_entry_id: UUID of created gold ledger entry
             - gold_weight_grams: Amount of gold used (3 decimals)
             - rate_per_gram: Conversion rate (2 decimals)
             - gold_money_value: Calculated payment amount (2 decimals)
             - transaction_id: UUID of created transaction
             - transaction_number: TXN-YYYY-NNNN
             - new_paid_amount: Updated total paid on invoice
             - new_balance_due: Remaining balance on invoice
             - payment_status: "paid" or "partial"
             - customer_gold_balance_remaining: Customer's gold balance after payment (3 decimals)
          
          10. ✅ Backward Compatibility:
              - All existing payment modes (Cash, Bank Transfer, Card, UPI/Online, Cheque) continue to work
              - Standard payment modes unchanged - still require amount and account_id
              - No breaking changes to existing invoice payment workflow
          
          Key Business Rules Implemented:
          - ✅ Works ONLY for saved customers (not walk-in)
          - ✅ Creates GoldLedgerEntry (type=OUT) to track gold usage
          - ✅ Creates Transaction record for financial reporting
          - ✅ Reduces invoice balance_due by gold_money_value
          - ✅ Updates invoice payment_status (paid/partial) correctly
          - ✅ Validates sufficient gold balance before allowing payment
          - ✅ Prevents overpayment (gold value cannot exceed balance_due)
          - ✅ All operations are atomic (all succeed or all fail)
          - ✅ Complete audit trail maintained
          - ✅ Proper precision: 3 decimals for gold, 2 decimals for money
          - ✅ Auto-creates "Gold Exchange" account if needed
          - ✅ Returns remaining customer gold balance for verification
          
          Financial Flow Example:
          
          Scenario: Customer has 50.500g gold with shop (IN entries), wants to pay 500 OMR invoice
          
          Step 1: Customer initiates GOLD_EXCHANGE payment:
          - gold_weight_grams: 25.000g
          - rate_per_gram: 20.00 OMR
          
          Step 2: System auto-calculates:
          - gold_money_value = 25.000 × 20.00 = 500.00 OMR
          
          Step 3: System validates:
          - Customer has 50.500g available ✅ (sufficient)
          - Payment 500.00 OMR <= invoice balance 500.00 OMR ✅ (valid)
          
          Step 4: System creates 3 atomic records:
          a. GoldLedgerEntry (type=OUT, weight=25.000g) - reduces customer gold balance
          b. Transaction (mode=GOLD_EXCHANGE, amount=500.00 OMR) - financial trace
          c. Invoice update (paid_amount=500.00, balance_due=0.00, status=paid)
          
          Step 5: Result:
          - Customer gold balance: 50.500g - 25.000g = 25.500g remaining
          - Invoice status: PAID
          - Complete audit trail maintained
          
          READY FOR COMPREHENSIVE TESTING - Need to verify:
          1. Create invoice for saved customer with outstanding balance
          2. Ensure customer has gold IN entries (gold balance available)
          3. Attempt GOLD_EXCHANGE payment with valid gold and rate
          4. Verify gold_money_value calculated correctly (weight × rate)
          5. Verify GoldLedgerEntry created (type=OUT, purpose=exchange)
          6. Verify Transaction record created (mode=GOLD_EXCHANGE)
          7. Verify invoice paid_amount and balance_due updated correctly
          8. Verify invoice payment_status changes (paid/partial)
          9. Verify customer gold balance reduced correctly
          10. Validation: Attempt GOLD_EXCHANGE for walk-in customer (should fail with 400)
          11. Validation: Insufficient gold balance (should fail with 400)
          12. Validation: Overpayment attempt (should fail with 400)
          13. Validation: Invalid gold_weight_grams (0 or negative, should fail)
          14. Validation: Invalid rate_per_gram (0 or negative, should fail)
          15. Verify "Gold Exchange" account auto-created if doesn't exist
          16. Verify all 3 audit logs created with correct details
          17. Verify response includes all GOLD_EXCHANGE specific fields
          18. Verify precision: 3 decimals for gold, 2 decimals for money
          19. Test partial payment scenario (gold value < balance_due)
          20. Test full payment scenario (gold value = balance_due)

        comment: "MAJOR ARCHITECTURAL CHANGE - Direct Inventory Reduction: Changed stock tracking from ledger-style (sum of movements) to direct balance system. Changes: (1) Added current_qty and current_weight fields to InventoryHeader model for direct stock tracking.

(3) Modified GET /api/inventory/stock-totals to return current values from headers instead of aggregating movements. (4) CRITICAL CHANGE in POST /api/invoices/{id}/finalize - Now DIRECTLY reduces current_qty and current_weight from inventory headers based on invoice item categories. Stock movements still created as audit trail. Validation added to prevent insufficient stock errors. (5) Added category field to InvoiceItem model to track which inventory category to reduce from. (6) Updated job card to invoice conversion to include category field. (7) Created migration script to initialize current stock values from existing movements.

        comment: "IMPLEMENTED - Stock deduction now directly reduces from inventory category quantities and weights. Key changes: (1) InventoryHeader now has current_qty and current_weight fields that store actual stock levels. (2) When invoice is finalized, system matches invoice items to inventory categories by name and directly reduces the current stock values. (3) Stock movements are still created for audit trail but inventory totals come from header fields, not movement calculations. (4) Added validation to prevent stock from going negative with clear error messages showing available vs required quantities. (5) Migration script created to calculate current stock from existing movements for backward compatibility. Ready for testing to verify: (a) Stock movements update header values, (b) Invoice finalization reduces stock directly from headers, (c) Insufficient stock validation works, (d) Audit trail is maintained through movements, (e) Stock totals display correctly from header values."

Backend changes: (1) Updated Invoice model - Added customer_type field ('saved' or 'walk_in'), walk_in_name, walk_in_phone fields for walk-in customers only. Customer_id/customer_name now only for saved customers. (2) Modified POST /api/jobcards/{jobcard_id}/convert-to-invoice - Now accepts customer_type in request body. For saved: requires customer_id. For walk_in: requires walk_in_name. Validates customer data based on type. (3) Created NEW endpoint POST /api/invoices/{invoice_id}/add-payment - Accepts amount, payment_mode (Cash/Bank Transfer/Card/UPI/Online/Cheque), account_id (where money goes), notes. Creates Transaction record for ALL payments. For saved customers: links to party_id. For walk-in: party_id=None, party_name includes '(Walk-in)' suffix. Updates invoice paid_amount and balance_due. Returns warning flag is_walk_in_partial_payment if walk-in customer has outstanding balance. All payments now properly tracked in finance system. Ready for testing."

Test Results: ✅ Created walk-in job card with customer_type='walk_in', walk_in_name='John Walk-in Customer', walk_in_phone='+968 9999 1234'. ✅ Converted to walk-in invoice successfully (invoice_id: a2af6e42-f603-409a-9da0-82b4869c732b, grand_total: 229.95). ✅ Finalized walk-in invoice successfully. ✅ CRITICAL SUCCESS: Transaction record CREATED for walk-in invoice finalization. Transaction Verification (All 10 checks PASSED): ✅ reference_type = 'invoice' (correct), ✅ reference_id = invoice_id (correct), ✅ category = 'Sales Invoice' (correct), ✅ mode = 'invoice' (correct), ✅ party_id = None for walk-in (correct), ✅ party_name = None for walk-in (correct), ✅ notes contain walk_in_name 'John Walk-in Customer' (correct), ✅ notes contain walk_in_phone '+968 9999 1234' (correct), ✅ amount = 229.95 matches invoice grand_total (correct), ✅ transaction_number format TXN-2026-0001 (correct).

Changes: (1) Added invoice status badge column showing 'Draft' (blue) or 'Finalized' (green with lock icon). (2) Added 'Finalize' button for draft invoices with confirmation dialog explaining all consequences (stock deduction, invoice lock, job card lock, ledger entry creation). (3) Separated invoice status from payment status for clarity. (4) Added informational card explaining Draft vs Finalized workflow. (5) Button shows loading state while finalizing and is disabled during process. (6) Finalized invoices only show Print button, draft invoices show both Finalize and Print buttons. This completes the full invoice state management implementation - backend was correct but frontend lacked the UI to trigger finalization, meaning all invoices stayed in draft state forever with no stock deduction happening. Now users can properly finalize invoices through a clear, safe workflow. READY FOR TESTING - Need to verify: (a) Draft invoices display correctly with status badge, (b) Finalize button appears and works, (c) Confirmation dialog shows, (d) Status updates to Finalized after confirmation, (e) Finalize button disappears for finalized invoices, (f) Stock movements are created, (g) Job cards get locked, (h) Customer ledger entries are created."

          MODULE 7 FRONTEND IMPLEMENTED - Invoice Discount UI with Print View Integration.
          
          Frontend Implementation:
          
          1. ✅ JobCardsPage.js - Convert to Invoice Dialog Enhanced (lines 126-175, 823-844):
             ADDED DISCOUNT INPUT FIELD:
             - New discount_amount input field in convert dialog (after customer details)
             - Input type: number with step="0.001" for 3 decimal precision
             - Minimum value: 0 (enforced by HTML5 validation)
             - Placeholder: "0.000"
             - Helper text: "Optional: Enter discount amount to be applied before VAT calculation"
             - Field appears for BOTH saved and walk-in customers
          
          2. ✅ Convert Dialog State Management:
             - Added discount_amount to convertData state initialization (default: 0)
             - Initialize discount_amount when opening convert dialog for both customer types
             - handleConfirmConvert sends discount_amount to backend API:
               * Parses value with parseFloat(convertData.discount_amount) || 0
               * Ensures 0 is sent if field is empty or invalid
          
          3. ✅ InvoicesPage.js - Print PDF Enhanced (lines 111-135):
             ADDED DISCOUNT LINE IN PDF:
             - Conditional display: Only shows discount line if discount_amount > 0
             - Position: Between Subtotal and VAT Total (as per standard invoice format)
             - Format: "Discount: -{discount_amount:.3f} OMR" (negative sign prefix)
             - Uses dynamic positioning (currentY variable) to handle conditional spacing
             - Maintains proper alignment with other totals
          
          4. ✅ Print Layout Flow:
             Standard invoice totals section now follows this order:
             1. Subtotal (always shown)
             2. Discount (conditionally shown if > 0)
             3. VAT Total (always shown)
             4. Grand Total (always shown, bold)
             5. Balance Due (always shown, color-coded)
             6. Payment Status (always shown)
          
          UI/UX Features:
          - ✅ Clear labeling: "Discount Amount (OMR)"
          - ✅ 3 decimal precision matches backend and OMR currency standard
          - ✅ Optional field (not required) - defaults to 0 if empty
          - ✅ Positioned logically in convert dialog (after customer selection)
          - ✅ Helper text explains when discount is applied (before VAT)
          - ✅ Print view clearly shows discount as deduction (negative sign)
          - ✅ Print view spacing adjusts dynamically based on discount presence
          
          READY FOR UI TESTING - Need to verify:
          1. Convert dialog shows discount input field
          2. Discount field accepts decimal values (0.000 format)
          3. Discount field prevents negative values (HTML5 validation)
          4. Converting without entering discount defaults to 0
          5. Converting with discount value passes it to backend
          6. Print PDF shows discount line when discount > 0
          7. Print PDF hides discount line when discount = 0
          8. Print PDF alignment and spacing is correct
          9. Discount appears as negative value in print view

(2) Added convertData state for customer type, customer selection, walk-in name/phone. (3) Created Convert Dialog with radio buttons for customer type selection. For 'Saved Customer': Shows party dropdown with existing customers, displays info about ledger tracking and outstanding. For 'Walk-in Customer': Shows name input (required) and phone input (optional), displays warning that walk-in customers are NOT saved in Parties and full payment is recommended. (4) Updated Convert to Invoice button to pass entire jobcard object instead of just ID. InvoicesPage changes: (1) Added payment dialog functionality with accounts loading. (2) Updated invoice table to show 'Walk-in' badge for walk-in customers with walk_in_name display. (3) Added 'Add Payment' button for all invoices with balance_due > 0. (4) Created payment dialog with: amount input (default to full balance), payment mode dropdown (Cash/Bank Transfer/Card/UPI/Online/Cheque), account selection (where money goes), notes field. Shows walk-in warning for partial payments. (5) handleAddPayment function calls POST /api/invoices/{id}/add-payment and shows warning toast for walk-in partial payments.

        comment: "CRITICAL FIX - Added Toggle Option in Job Card Creation Form: User reported missing toggle to select between walk-in and saved customers in job card creation. ROOT CAUSE: Customer type selection was only available during invoice conversion, not during job card creation itself. FIX IMPLEMENTED: (1) Added prominent Customer Type radio button section at the top of job card form with 'Saved Customer' and 'Walk-in Customer' options. (2) Dynamic form fields based on selection: For Saved Customer - Shows party dropdown with ledger tracking info message. For Walk-in Customer - Shows name input (required) and phone input (optional) with warning that walk-in customers are NOT saved in Parties. (3) Updated job card table to display walk-in badge next to customer name for easy identification. (4) Enhanced convert-to-invoice dialog to show job card's original customer type and pre-populate fields accordingly. (5) Form validation ensures: saved customers must select from parties, walk-in customers must enter name. RESULT: Users now have clear, upfront control over customer handling from job card creation. Walk-in vs saved distinction is visible throughout the entire workflow. Backend already supported these fields (customer_type, walk_in_name, walk_in_phone). Payment tracking creates Transaction records for all payments as required. Ready for testing."

      MODULE 8/10 IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE - JobCard Gold Rate Field + Auto-fill Invoice Rate
      
      Backend Changes:
      - ✅ Added gold_rate_at_jobcard field to JobCard model (Optional[float], 2 decimal precision)
      - ✅ POST /api/jobcards accepts and stores gold_rate_at_jobcard
      - ✅ PATCH /api/jobcards/{id} allows updating gold_rate_at_jobcard
      - ✅ CRITICAL: convert_jobcard_to_invoice now uses priority chain:
        * Priority 1: invoice_data.metal_rate (user override)
        * Priority 2: jobcard.gold_rate_at_jobcard (auto-fill from job card)
        * Priority 3: Default 20.0 (backward compatibility fallback)
      - ✅ Previous hardcoded metal_rate = 20.0 replaced with dynamic rate selection
      - ✅ Rate applied consistently to ALL invoice items
      
      Frontend Changes:
      - ✅ Added "Gold Rate (per gram) - OMR" input field in job card form
      - ✅ Field positioned after Status and before Notes section
      - ✅ Input validation: type="number", step="0.01", min="0"
      - ✅ Helper text explains: "This rate will auto-fill when converting to invoice"
      - ✅ formData state includes gold_rate_at_jobcard with proper parsing
      - ✅ handleEditJobCard loads existing gold rate for editing
      - ✅ handleCloseDialog resets gold rate on form close
      - ✅ Convert dialog enhanced with gold rate display:
        * Shows amber-colored info card when job card has gold rate
        * Format: "💰 Gold Rate from Job Card: {rate} OMR/gram"
        * Positioned between job card info and customer type selection
      
      Key Features:
      - ✅ Backward compatible: optional field, existing job cards work fine
      - ✅ Historical record: rate stored at job card creation time
      - ✅ Auto-fill reduces manual data entry during conversion
      - ✅ Visual feedback in convert dialog for transparency
      - ✅ User can override if needed (priority chain supports it)
      - ✅ 2 decimal precision maintained throughout
      
      READY FOR COMPREHENSIVE TESTING:
      1. Create job card WITH gold rate (e.g., 25.50) → verify stored correctly
      2. Create job card WITHOUT gold rate → verify works with default
      3. Edit job card and change gold rate → verify update works
      4. Convert job card WITH gold rate → verify invoice items use that rate
      5. Convert job card WITHOUT gold rate → verify default 20.0 used
      6. Convert dialog display → verify gold rate shown correctly
      7. Existing job cards (before Module 8) → verify backward compatibility
      8. Field validation → verify negative rates prevented (min="0")
      9. Decimal precision → verify accepts 0.01 step values
      10. Priority chain → verify invoice_data override works if needed

    message: "CRITICAL BUSINESS LOGIC FIX IMPLEMENTED: Invoice state management now properly implemented. Invoices are created in 'draft' status with NO stock deduction. Stock OUT movements ONLY happen when invoice is explicitly finalized via new POST /api/invoices/{id}/finalize endpoint. Finalized invoices are immutable (cannot be edited or deleted). This ensures financial integrity and prevents premature inventory deduction. READY FOR COMPREHENSIVE TESTING - please test all invoice workflows: create draft, edit draft, finalize, attempt to edit finalized (should fail), verify stock movements only happen on finalization."

      ✅ COMPREHENSIVE TEST EXECUTION:
      1. ✅ Created test party: Summary Test Party 202400 (customer type)
      2. ✅ Created 3 gold ledger entries with mixed IN/OUT types:
         - IN: 125.456g (job_work) - Party gives gold to shop
         - OUT: 50.123g (exchange) - Shop gives gold to party  
         - IN: 30.250g (advance_gold) - Additional gold from party
      3. ✅ Created invoice with outstanding balance: INV-2026-0001 (459.375 OMR balance_due)
      4. ✅ Created credit transaction: TXN-2026-0001 (150.0 OMR credit type)
      5. ✅ Tested GET /api/parties/{party_id}/summary endpoint successfully

      - Money section: money_due_from_party, money_due_to_party, net_money_balance, total_invoices, total_transactions ✅
      
      ✅ CALCULATION ACCURACY VERIFICATION:
      Gold Calculations (3 decimal precision):
      - Gold due from party: 155.706g (125.456 + 30.250 IN entries) ✅
      - Gold due to party: 50.123g (OUT entries) ✅  
      - Net gold balance: 105.583g (positive = party owes shop) ✅
      - Total entries: 3 ✅
      
      Money Calculations (2 decimal precision):
      - Money due from party: 459.38 OMR (invoice balance_due aggregation) ✅
      - Money due to party: 150.00 OMR (credit transaction aggregation) ✅
      - Net money balance: 309.38 OMR (positive = party owes shop) ✅
      - Total invoices: 1, Total transactions: 1 ✅
      
      ✅ PRECISION FORMATTING VERIFICATION:
      - Gold values maintain exactly 3 decimal places ✅
      - Money values maintain exactly 2 decimal places ✅
      
      🔥 CRITICAL BUSINESS LOGIC CONFIRMED:
      - IN entries correctly add to gold_due_from_party (party owes shop)
      - OUT entries correctly add to gold_due_to_party (shop owes party)
      - Invoice balance_due correctly aggregates to money_due_from_party
      - Credit transactions correctly aggregate to money_due_to_party
      - Net balances calculated correctly (positive = party owes shop)

      ✅ MODULE 7/10 - INVOICE DISCOUNT (AMOUNT BASED) IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE
      
      Implemented comprehensive invoice discount feature with amount-based discounts and proper VAT recalculation.
      
      BACKEND CHANGES:
      1. ✅ Invoice Model Enhancement:
         - Added discount_amount field (float, 3 decimal precision, default 0.0)
         - Backward compatible - existing invoices default to 0 discount
      
      2. ✅ Calculation Formula Updated (convert_jobcard_to_invoice):
         - Step 1: Calculate subtotal = sum(gold_value + making_value)
         - Step 2: Apply discount = subtotal - discount_amount
         - Step 3: Calculate taxable = subtotal - discount
         - Step 4: Calculate VAT = taxable × 5% (NOT subtotal × 5%)
         - Step 5: Calculate grand_total = taxable + VAT
         - VAT is distributed proportionally across items
      
      3. ✅ Validation Rules:
         - Discount amount must be >= 0 (prevents negative discounts)
         - Discount amount cannot exceed subtotal (prevents negative taxable)
         - Clear 400 error messages for validation failures
      
      4. ✅ Backend PDF Enhanced:
         - Shows discount line between Subtotal and VAT when discount > 0
         - Format: "Discount: -{amount:.2f} OMR"
         - Dynamic spacing adjusts based on discount presence
      
      FRONTEND CHANGES:
      1. ✅ JobCardsPage - Convert to Invoice Dialog:
         - Added discount_amount input field (number, step 0.001)
         - Positioned after customer details, before action buttons
         - Helper text: "Optional: Enter discount amount to be applied before VAT calculation"
         - Defaults to 0 if not entered
      
      2. ✅ InvoicesPage - Print PDF:
         - Shows discount line in totals section when discount > 0
         - Proper order: Subtotal → Discount → VAT → Grand Total → Balance Due
         - Discount appears as negative value with minus sign prefix
      
      BUSINESS LOGIC:
      - ✅ Discount applies to ENTIRE invoice (not per item)
      - ✅ Discount deducted BEFORE VAT calculation
      - ✅ VAT calculated on (subtotal - discount), maintaining tax compliance
      - ✅ All monetary values maintain 3 decimal precision (OMR standard)
      - ✅ Backward compatible with existing invoices
      
      READY FOR TESTING - Test scenarios:
      1. Convert job card to invoice WITH discount (e.g., 10.500 OMR)
      2. Convert job card to invoice WITHOUT discount (default 0)
      3. Test validation: negative discount (should fail)
      4. Test validation: discount > subtotal (should fail)
      5. Verify calculation: VAT = (subtotal - discount) × 5%
      6. Verify print PDF shows discount line correctly
      7. Verify print PDF hides discount line when discount = 0
      8. Verify grand_total = (subtotal - discount) + VAT

      🎯 MODULE 3/10 - PURCHASES MODULE IMPLEMENTED (Stock IN + Vendor Payable)
      
      Complete vendor purchase tracking system with draft/finalized workflow, stock management, and vendor payable accounting.
      
      BACKEND IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE:
      
      1. ✅ Purchase Model Created (lines 277-298):
         - Complete draft/finalized workflow (status field)
         - Vendor validation (vendor_party_id must be vendor type)
         - Dual purity tracking: entered_purity (informational) + valuation_purity_fixed (always 916 for calculations)
         - Financial fields: weight_grams (3 decimals), rate_per_gram (2 decimals), amount_total (2 decimals)
         - Lock mechanism for finalized purchases (locked, locked_at, locked_by)
         - Complete audit trail (created_at, created_by, finalized_at, finalized_by)
         - Soft delete support (is_deleted, deleted_at, deleted_by)
      
      2. ✅ POST /api/purchases - Create Draft Purchase:
         - Validates vendor_party_id exists and is vendor type (not customer)
         - Enforces proper precision (3 decimals for weight, 2 for money)
         - Forces valuation_purity_fixed = 916 for all purchases
         - Creates audit log
      
      3. ✅ GET /api/purchases - Retrieve Purchases:
         - Filter by vendor_party_id (optional)
         - Filter by date range: start_date, end_date (optional)
         - Filter by status: draft/finalized (optional)
         - Sorted by date descending
      
      4. ✅ PATCH /api/purchases/{id} - Edit Draft Purchase:
         - Only draft purchases can be edited (finalized purchases rejected with 400)
         - Validates vendor if changed
         - Enforces precision on all numeric updates
         - Creates audit log
      
      5. ✅ POST /api/purchases/{id}/finalize - CRITICAL ATOMIC OPERATIONS:
         
         a. UPDATE PURCHASE STATUS:
            - status = "finalized"
            - finalized_at, finalized_by recorded
            - locked = True (prevents further edits)
            - locked_at, locked_by recorded
         
         b. CREATE STOCK IN MOVEMENT:
            - Finds/creates inventory header for 916 purity (Gold 22K)
            - Creates StockMovement with positive values (adding stock)
            - Uses valuation_purity_fixed (916) NOT entered_purity
            - Links to purchase via reference_type/reference_id
            - Updates inventory header current_qty and current_weight
         
         c. CREATE VENDOR PAYABLE TRANSACTION:
            - Auto-generates transaction_number (TXN-YYYY-NNNN)
            - Creates Transaction with transaction_type = "credit" (we owe vendor)
            - Links to vendor party
            - Links to purchase via reference_type/reference_id
            - Category = "Purchase"
         
         d. CREATE AUDIT LOG:
            - Records all IDs (purchase, stock movement, transaction)
            - Records weight_added, purity_used, vendor_payable_amount
         
         e. RETURN COMPREHENSIVE RESPONSE:
            - All IDs for verification
            - Success message
      
      KEY BUSINESS RULES IMPLEMENTED:
      - ✅ Entered purity stored as vendor claimed (e.g., 999, 995) for reference
      - ✅ Valuation purity ALWAYS 916 for stock calculations and accounting
      - ✅ Only draft purchases can be edited (finalized are immutable)
      - ✅ Stock IN adds to inventory at 916 purity (22K gold)
      - ✅ Vendor payable created as credit transaction (liability)
      - ✅ All finalization operations are atomic (all succeed or all fail)
      - ✅ Complete audit trail maintained
      - ✅ Proper precision enforced (3 decimals weight, 2 decimals money)
      
      READY FOR COMPREHENSIVE BACKEND TESTING:
      
      Test Scenarios Required:
      1. ✅ Create draft purchase - verify vendor validation, precision rounding, defaults
      2. ✅ Edit draft purchase - verify updates work, validation applied
      3. ✅ Attempt to edit finalized purchase - must fail with 400 and clear error
      4. ✅ Finalize purchase - verify all 5 atomic operations:
         - Purchase status = finalized, locked = True
         - Stock IN movement created with 916 purity (not entered purity)
         - Inventory header current stock increased correctly
         - Vendor payable transaction created as credit with correct amount
         - Audit log created with all details
      5. ✅ Attempt to re-finalize - must fail with 400
      6. ✅ Filter purchases - by vendor, date range, status
      7. ✅ Verify entered_purity stored but 916 used for calculations
      8. ✅ Verify precision - weights at 3 decimals, amounts at 2 decimals
      
      Similar to Invoice finalization which is 100% working. This follows the exact same proven pattern.

      🎯 MODULE 4/10 - PURCHASE PAYMENTS + GOLD SETTLEMENT IMPLEMENTED
      
      Enhanced the Purchases Module with comprehensive payment tracking and gold settlement options for flexible vendor payment workflows.
      
      BACKEND IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE:
      
      1. ✅ Purchase Model Enhanced with 6 NEW fields:
         - paid_amount_money (float, 2 decimals, default 0.0)
         - balance_due_money (float, 2 decimals, auto-calculated)
         - payment_mode (Optional: Cash/Bank Transfer/Card/UPI/Online/Cheque)
         - account_id (Optional: payment account reference)
         - advance_in_gold_grams (Optional, 3 decimals: gold we gave vendor previously)
         - exchange_in_gold_grams (Optional, 3 decimals: gold from vendor during purchase)
      
      2. ✅ POST /api/purchases Enhanced:
         - Accepts payment and gold settlement fields
         - Auto-calculates balance_due_money = amount_total - paid_amount_money
         - Validates account exists if payment made
         - Maintains precision: 3 decimals gold, 2 decimals money
      
      3. ✅ PATCH /api/purchases/{id} Enhanced:
         - Allows updating payment/gold fields (draft only)
         - Recalculates balance_due_money on changes
         - Validates account when payment amount changes
      
      4. ✅ POST /api/purchases/{id}/finalize CRITICAL ENHANCEMENT:
         Now intelligently creates UP TO 8 atomic operations based on settlement method:
         
         a. Update purchase status → always
         b. Create Stock IN movement → always
         c. Create DEBIT transaction → IF paid_amount_money > 0
         d. Create GoldLedger OUT → IF advance_in_gold_grams > 0
         e. Create GoldLedger IN → IF exchange_in_gold_grams > 0
         f. Create CREDIT vendor payable → IF balance_due_money > 0
         g. Create audit log → always
         h. Return comprehensive response → always
      
      KEY FEATURES:
      - ✅ Flexible settlement: cash, gold, or mixed
      - ✅ Payment creates DEBIT transaction (reduces our account)
      - ✅ Advance gold creates OUT entry (settles vendor's advance)
      - ✅ Exchange gold creates IN entry (vendor gives us gold)
      - ✅ Vendor payable ONLY for remaining balance_due_money
      - ✅ All operations remain atomic (succeed/fail together)
      - ✅ Complete audit trail for all settlement methods
      - ✅ Proper precision: 3 decimals gold, 2 decimals money
      
      SETTLEMENT EXAMPLES:
      
      Example 1: Full Cash Payment
      - Total: 1000 OMR, Paid: 1000 OMR, Balance: 0 OMR
      - Creates: Stock IN + DEBIT(1000) + NO vendor payable
      
      Example 2: Partial Payment
      - Total: 1000 OMR, Paid: 600 OMR, Balance: 400 OMR
      - Creates: Stock IN + DEBIT(600) + CREDIT(400)
      
      Example 3: Gold Advance Settlement
      - Total: 1000 OMR, Advance Gold: 25.5g, Balance: 1000 OMR
      - Creates: Stock IN + GoldLedger OUT(25.5g) + CREDIT(1000)
      - Note: Gold tracked separately, doesn't reduce money balance
      
      Example 4: Mixed Settlement
      - Total: 1000 OMR, Paid: 400 OMR, Advance: 10.25g, Exchange: 5.125g, Balance: 600 OMR
      - Creates: Stock IN + DEBIT(400) + GoldLedger OUT(10.25g) + GoldLedger IN(5.125g) + CREDIT(600)
      
      READY FOR COMPREHENSIVE BACKEND TESTING:
      
      Critical Test Scenarios:
      1. Create purchase with payment fields → verify balance auto-calculation
      2. Create purchase with gold settlement → verify precision (3 decimals)
      3. Finalize with ONLY payment → verify DEBIT created, NO vendor payable if balance=0
      4. Finalize with ONLY advance gold → verify GoldLedger OUT created
      5. Finalize with ONLY exchange gold → verify GoldLedger IN created
      6. Finalize with mixed settlement → verify all transactions/entries created
      7. Verify vendor payable uses balance_due_money (not amount_total)
      8. Verify all IDs returned in finalize response
      9. Edit draft purchase → verify balance recalculated
      10. Verify account validation when paid_amount_money > 0
      
      This module provides complete flexibility in how vendors are paid - cash, gold settlements, or any combination thereof.

             - Handles both saved customers and walk-in customers
             - For saved customers: fetches customer_name and phone from parties collection
             - For walk-in customers: uses walk_in_name and walk_in_phone from invoice
             
             Calculations:
             - total_weight_grams: Sums weight from all invoice items (3 decimal precision)
             - purity_summary: Shows single purity if all items same (e.g., "22K"), 
                               shows "Mixed" if items have different purities,
                               shows "N/A" if no purity data

             - date_to: Optional date filter (end of range)
             - vendor_id: Optional vendor filter (or "all" for all vendors)
             - search: Optional search string for vendor name, phone, or description
             
             Critical Business Logic:
             - ONLY returns purchases with status = "finalized"

             - amount_total: Total purchase amount (2 decimal precision)
             
             Purity Conversion Logic:
             - valuation_purity_fixed is always 916 (from Purchase model)
             - Converted to karats: 916 / 41.67 ≈ 22K

      MODULE 9/10 - Customer Gold Deposit Feature has been implemented.
      
      Backend Changes:
      - Created POST /api/gold-deposits endpoint (lines 695-754 in server.py)
        * Creates GoldLedgerEntry with type="IN" for deposits
        * Validates all required fields (party_id, weight_grams, purity_entered, purpose)
        * Validates weight > 0 and party exists
        * Rounds weight to 3 decimal precision
        * Creates audit log
      
      - Created GET /api/gold-deposits endpoint (lines 756-797 in server.py)
        * Returns only type="IN" entries (deposits received)
        * Supports filtering by party_id, date_from, date_to
        * Sorted by date descending
        * Only returns non-deleted entries
      
      - Soft delete uses existing DELETE /api/gold-ledger/{entry_id} endpoint
      
      Frontend Changes:
      - Added "Add Gold Deposit" button in party ledger dialog (lines 613-625)
        * Styled with amber theme colors
        * Shows Plus icon
        * Positioned next to gold ledger section title
      
      - Created gold deposit dialog (lines 751-835)
        * Form fields: weight_grams (number, 3 decimals), purity_entered (number), purpose (dropdown), notes (text, optional)
        * Validation before submission
        * Loading state during API call
        * Success/error toast notifications
        * Auto-refresh gold entries and summary after successful deposit
      
      - Added state management and handlers (lines 18, 42-47, 179-281)
        * depositFormData state for form inputs
        * showGoldDepositDialog for dialog visibility
        * handleOpenGoldDeposit to open dialog
        * handleCreateGoldDeposit to submit form
      
      Key Features:
      - ✅ Clean UI with clear labels and helper text
      - ✅ Form validation (weight > 0, purity > 0)
      - ✅ API validation (party exists, valid purpose)
      - ✅ 3 decimal precision for weight
      - ✅ Dropdown for purpose selection
      - ✅ Optional notes field

      MODULE 10/10 - Gold Exchange Payment Mode (Convert Gold → Money Settlement) has been implemented.
      
      Backend Changes:
      - Enhanced POST /api/invoices/{invoice_id}/add-payment endpoint (lines 1865-2260 in server.py)
        * NEW payment mode: "GOLD_EXCHANGE" (in addition to existing Cash, Bank Transfer, Card, UPI/Online, Cheque)
        * Only works for saved customers (requires party_id for gold ledger tracking)
        * Walk-in customers cannot use GOLD_EXCHANGE mode (validation enforced)
      
      Key Features:
      1. ✅ Input Fields for GOLD_EXCHANGE:
         - gold_weight_grams: float (3 decimal precision) - amount of gold to use for payment
         - rate_per_gram: float (2 decimal precision) - conversion rate gold → money
         - purity_entered: Optional int (defaults to 916 - 22K gold)
      
      2. ✅ Auto-Calculation:
         - gold_money_value = gold_weight_grams × rate_per_gram (2 decimal precision)
         - This value reduces invoice balance_due
      
      3. ✅ Comprehensive Validation:
         - Customer must be saved (not walk-in) → 400 error if walk-in
         - gold_weight_grams must be > 0 → 400 error if invalid
         - rate_per_gram must be > 0 → 400 error if invalid
         - Customer must have sufficient gold balance (IN - OUT >= requested) → 400 error with balance details
         - gold_money_value cannot exceed invoice balance_due → 400 error if overpayment
      
      4. ✅ Creates GoldLedgerEntry (type=OUT):
         - Type: "OUT" (customer uses their gold with shop to pay invoice)
         - Purpose: "exchange" (gold exchange for payment settlement)
         - Reference: invoice_id (links payment to invoice)
         - Notes: Includes invoice number, rate, and calculation
      
      5. ✅ Creates Transaction Record (Financial Trace):
         - transaction_type: "credit" (money coming in)
         - mode: "GOLD_EXCHANGE"
         - account: "Gold Exchange" (auto-created if doesn't exist)
         - amount: gold_money_value
         - category: "Invoice Payment"
         - Links to invoice and party
         - Auto-generates transaction_number (TXN-YYYY-NNNN)
      
      6. ✅ Updates Invoice Payment Fields:
         - paid_amount += gold_money_value
         - balance_due = grand_total - paid_amount (max 0, no negative)
         - payment_status: "paid" if balance_due < 0.01, else "partial"
      
      7. ✅ Complete Audit Trail (3 Audit Logs):
         - Gold ledger entry creation
         - Transaction record creation
         - Invoice payment update (includes gold balance before/after)
      
      8. ✅ Enhanced Response:
         - All standard payment fields (transaction_id, new_paid_amount, etc.)
         - PLUS gold-specific fields (gold_ledger_entry_id, gold_weight_grams, rate_per_gram, gold_money_value)
         - PLUS customer_gold_balance_remaining (for verification)
      
      Business Rules:
      - ✅ ONLY saved customers can use GOLD_EXCHANGE (need party_id for ledger)
      - ✅ Customer must have sufficient gold balance (validated before processing)
      - ✅ All operations atomic (all succeed or all fail together)
      - ✅ Creates both GoldLedgerEntry AND Transaction for complete tracking
      - ✅ Reduces invoice balance_due by gold money value
      - ✅ Proper precision: 3 decimals gold, 2 decimals money
      - ✅ Backward compatible: all existing payment modes unchanged
      - ✅ Auto-creates "Gold Exchange" account if needed
      
      Ready for backend testing. Please test:
      1. Setup: Create saved customer party with gold IN entries (has gold balance)
      2. Setup: Create invoice for that customer with balance due
      3. GOLD_EXCHANGE payment with sufficient gold balance → success
      4. Verify gold_money_value = gold_weight_grams × rate_per_gram
      5. Verify GoldLedgerEntry created (type=OUT, purpose=exchange, references invoice)
      6. Verify Transaction created (mode=GOLD_EXCHANGE, correct amount)
      7. Verify invoice paid_amount and balance_due updated correctly
      8. Verify invoice payment_status (paid if fully paid, partial if not)
      9. Verify customer gold balance reduced correctly
      10. Verify response includes all gold-specific fields
      11. Validation Test: GOLD_EXCHANGE for walk-in customer → 400 error
      12. Validation Test: Insufficient gold balance → 400 error with details
      13. Validation Test: gold_weight_grams = 0 → 400 error
      14. Validation Test: rate_per_gram = 0 → 400 error
      15. Validation Test: Overpayment (gold value > balance) → 400 error
      16. Verify "Gold Exchange" account auto-created if doesn't exist
      17. Verify all 3 audit logs created with correct details
      18. Test partial payment (gold value < balance_due) → payment_status=partial
      19. Test full payment (gold value = balance_due) → payment_status=paid
      20. Verify precision: gold at 3 decimals, money at 2 decimals

      🔧 CRITICAL FIX: Walk-in Invoice Transaction Creation Issue RESOLVED
      
      Issue Identified by Testing Agent:
      - Transaction records were NOT being created when walk-in invoices were finalized
      - This caused incomplete financial ledger for walk-in customers
      - All other invoice finalization logic (stock deduction, payments) was working correctly
      
      Root Cause Analysis:
      - In finalize_invoice function (line 1787), the transaction creation logic had condition:
        `if invoice.customer_id and invoice.grand_total > 0:`
      - Walk-in invoices have customer_id = None (by design)
      - This condition evaluated to False for walk-in invoices
      - Therefore, NO transaction record was created during finalization
      
      Fix Applied (lines 1786-1859 in server.py):
      
      1. ✅ Changed Condition:
         - OLD: `if invoice.customer_id and invoice.grand_total > 0:`
         - NEW: `if invoice.grand_total > 0:`
         - Now creates transactions for BOTH saved and walk-in invoices
      
      2. ✅ Added Customer Type Logic:
         Walk-in invoices:
         - party_id = None (no saved party)
         - party_name = None
         - notes = "Invoice {number} finalized - Walk-in Customer: {walk_in_name} (Ph: {walk_in_phone})"
         
         Saved customer invoices:
         - party_id = invoice.customer_id
         - party_name = invoice.customer_name
         - notes = "Invoice {number} finalized"
      
      3. ✅ Enhanced Audit Logging:
         - Added customer_type field to audit log
         - Added is_walk_in flag for easy filtering
      
      4. ✅ Updated Finalization Audit:
         - Changed ledger_entry_created condition to reflect new logic
         - Now tracks customer_type in finalization audit
      
      Business Impact:
      - ✅ Walk-in invoice finalizations now create proper Transaction records
      - ✅ Financial ledger completeness maintained for ALL invoice types
      - ✅ Walk-in customer information preserved in transaction notes
      - ✅ All invoices tracked in "Sales Invoice" category
      - ✅ Outstanding balance calculations remain accurate
      - ✅ Backward compatible - saved customer transactions unchanged
      
      READY FOR RETESTING:
      Please retest walk-in invoice flow to verify:
      1. Walk-in job card creation ✅ (already working)
      2. Walk-in invoice creation ✅ (already working)
      3. Walk-in invoice finalization ✅ (already working)
      4. Stock deduction for walk-in invoice ✅ (already working)
      5. Walk-in payment processing ✅ (already working)
      6. 🔥 Transaction ledger entry creation during finalization (NOW FIXED - needs verification)
      
      Expected Result:
      - Transaction record should be created with:
        * transaction_type = "debit" (for sale/service invoices)
        * mode = "invoice"
        * account_id = Sales account ID
        * party_id = None (for walk-in)
        * party_name = None (for walk-in)
        * amount = grand_total
        * category = "Sales Invoice"
        * notes containing walk_in_name and walk_in_phone
        * reference_type = "invoice"
        * reference_id = invoice ID

          INVENTORY LISTING ENDPOINT IMPLEMENTED - Simplified inventory data access.
          
          Endpoint Details:
          - Method: GET /api/inventory
          - Authentication: Required (Bearer token)
          - Query Parameters:
            * category (optional): Filter by category name (case-insensitive regex)
            * min_qty (optional): Filter items with quantity >= min_qty
          - Response Format: JSON with formatted inventory list
          
          Response Structure:
          1. ✅ Items Array: List of inventory items with computed fields:
             - id: Unique identifier
             - category: Category name (from header name)
             - quantity: Current quantity (2 decimal precision)
             - weight_grams: Current weight in grams (3 decimal precision)
             - is_active: Active status flag
             - created_at: Creation timestamp
             - created_by: Creator user ID
             - status: Computed status ("low_stock" if qty < 5, else "in_stock")
          
          2. ✅ Aggregated Statistics:
             - total_count: Number of items in filtered result
             - total_weight_grams: Sum of all weights (3 decimal precision)
             - total_quantity: Sum of all quantities (2 decimal precision)
             - low_stock_count: Number of low stock items
             - timestamp: ISO format timestamp
          
          3. ✅ Documentation Note:
             - Includes helpful note directing users to detailed endpoints
             - Points to /api/inventory/headers and /api/inventory/movements for CRUD operations
          
          Features:
          - ✅ Wrapper around inventory_headers for simplified access
          - ✅ Category search with case-insensitive regex matching
          - ✅ Minimum quantity filtering for stock level queries
          - ✅ Automatic low stock status computation (qty < 5)
          - ✅ Sorted by weight descending (highest value items first)
          - ✅ Proper decimal precision maintained
          - ✅ Excludes soft-deleted items (is_deleted: False)
          - ✅ Aggregated statistics for quick insights
          - ✅ Error handling with detailed logging
          
          Query Examples:
          - GET /api/inventory → All inventory items
          - GET /api/inventory?category=gold → Items matching "gold"
          - GET /api/inventory?min_qty=10 → Items with qty >= 10
          - GET /api/inventory?category=22K&min_qty=5 → Combined filters
          
          Relationship to Existing Endpoints:
          - /api/inventory/headers → Full CRUD operations on categories
          - /api/inventory/movements → Stock movement tracking (IN/OUT)
          - /api/inventory/stock-totals → Simple totals view
          - /api/inventory → NEW simplified listing with filtering
          
          Business Value:
          - Provides simple inventory listing for basic queries
          - Reduces learning curve for new API consumers
          - Maintains compatibility with existing detailed endpoints
          - Low stock identification for restocking decisions
          
          READY FOR TESTING - Need to verify:
          1. Endpoint returns 200 status with valid token
          2. No filters: Returns all inventory items
          3. Category filter: Correctly filters by name (case-insensitive)
          4. Min quantity filter: Correctly filters by qty threshold
          5. Combined filters: Both filters applied correctly
          6. Status field: "low_stock" when qty < 5, "in_stock" otherwise
          7. Sorting: Items sorted by weight_grams descending
          8. Aggregated stats: Calculations match filtered items
          9. Precision: 3 decimals for weight, 2 for quantity
          10. Note field: Helpful message pointing to detailed endpoints

      API COMPLETENESS MODULE - Three new endpoints implemented for comprehensive API coverage.
      
      Implementation Summary:
      
      1. ✅ GET /api/dashboard:
         - Pre-aggregated statistics combining inventory, financial, parties, and job cards data
         - Single endpoint reduces frontend API calls from 4+ to 1
         - Returns comprehensive dashboard view with proper decimal precision
         - Includes recent activity (last 5 invoices)
      
      2. ✅ GET /api/reports:
         - Catalog of all 8 available report types with full metadata
         - Each report includes ID, name, description, category, endpoints, and capabilities
         - Enables dynamic UI generation (frontend can build reports menu from API)
         - Self-documenting - API consumers can discover available reports
      
      3. ✅ GET /api/inventory:
         - Simplified inventory listing with optional category and min_qty filters
         - Wrapper around inventory_headers for easier access
         - Includes computed status field (low_stock vs in_stock)
         - Sorted by weight descending, with aggregated statistics
         - Helpful note directing to detailed CRUD endpoints
      
      Design Decisions:
      - All endpoints maintain backward compatibility
      - No changes to existing endpoints or database schema
      - Duplicate functionality is intentional for API completeness
      - Dashboard and inventory endpoints aggregate existing data
      - Reports endpoint provides metadata only (doesn't duplicate data)
      
      Backend Status:
      - All 3 endpoints added to server.py (lines 527-783)
      - Backend restarted successfully
      - No compilation or startup errors
      - Proper authentication and error handling implemented
      
      Ready for comprehensive backend testing. Please test:
      1. GET /api/dashboard - Verify all sections and calculations
      2. GET /api/reports - Verify all 8 reports listed with correct metadata
      3. GET /api/inventory - Test with no filters, category filter, min_qty filter, and combined filters
      4. All endpoints return proper status codes (200 for success, 401 for unauthorized)
      5. Response structures match documentation
      6. Decimal precision correct (3 for gold weight, 2 for money/qty)
      7. Error handling works properly
