# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

Admin edits are logged with special 'admin_override_edit' action including reason, locked_at, locked_by, and changes.

Audit log created with action 'admin_override_edit' containing reason, locked_at, locked_by, and changes. ✅ Admin Delete Override: Admin successfully deleted locked job card with 200 success and warning message 'This job card was locked and linked to a finalized invoice'.

Locked job cards correctly reject edit/delete attempts with 400 errors. ✅ Customer Ledger Entry Creation - Transaction records created with correct party_id, amount=grand_total, category='Sales Invoice', transaction_type='debit' for service invoices. Auto-generated transaction numbers follow TXN-YYYY-NNNN format. ✅ Outstanding Balance Tracking - Party ledger calculations correctly aggregate invoice balance_due values. ✅ Direct Invoice Finalization - Invoices without job cards finalize correctly, creating stock movements and ledger entries without attempting job card locking. ✅ Default Sales Account Creation - Sales account automatically created with proper fields (created_by, account_type='asset') when needed. Fixed missing created_by field issue. ✅ Full Workflow Test - All 5 atomic operations work correctly: invoice finalization, stock OUT movements with negative values, job card locking, ledger entry creation, outstanding balance updates. ✅ Error Cases - Proper 400 errors for editing/deleting locked job cards, re-finalizing invoices, graceful handling of invoices without customers.

        comment: "CRITICAL FIX - Added missing invoice finalization UI that was preventing users from finalizing invoices. Changes: (1) Added invoice status badge column showing 'Draft' (blue) or 'Finalized' (green with lock icon). (2) Added 'Finalize' button for draft invoices with confirmation dialog explaining all consequences (stock deduction, invoice lock, job card lock, ledger entry creation). (3) Separated invoice status from payment status for clarity. (4) Added informational card explaining Draft vs Finalized workflow. (5) Button shows loading state while finalizing and is disabled during process. (6) Finalized invoices only show Print button, draft invoices show both Finalize and Print buttons. This completes the full invoice state management implementation - backend was correct but frontend lacked the UI to trigger finalization, meaning all invoices stayed in draft state forever with no stock deduction happening. Now users can properly finalize invoices through a clear, safe workflow. READY FOR TESTING - Need to verify: (a) Draft invoices display correctly with status badge, (b) Finalize button appears and works, (c) Confirmation dialog shows, (d) Status updates to Finalized after confirmation, (e) Finalize button disappears for finalized invoices, (f) Stock movements are created, (g) Job cards get locked, (h) Customer ledger entries are created."

Added comprehensive filtering (date range, status, type, category), view endpoints for displaying data in UI, individual report details (invoice, party ledger, inventory stock), and export with filters. Reports page now has tabbed interface with Inventory, Invoices, Parties, and Transactions sections. Backend CRUD operations were already implemented. Now ready for testing."
