# START - Testing Protocol - DO NOT EDIT OR REMOVE THIS SECTION
#====================================================================================================

# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"

##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

      ✅ CRITICAL API FIXES COMPLETED - PURCHASES & TRANSACTIONS ISSUES RESOLVED
      
      FIX STATUS: BOTH REPORTED ISSUES HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED
      
      🔧 FIXES IMPLEMENTED:
      ================================================================================
      
      1. ✅ PURCHASES API - VALIDATION ERROR FIXED
         Issue: "Endpoint expects Purchase model object but receives dictionary, causing validation errors"
         Root Cause: The create_purchase endpoint was directly accepting Purchase model as parameter instead of dictionary
         Fix Applied:
           - Changed parameter from `purchase: Purchase` to `purchase_data: dict`
           - Added proper data transformation and validation before model construction
           - Now follows same pattern as other endpoints (create_invoice, create_transaction, etc.)
           - All numeric fields are properly rounded to correct precision
           - Purchase model is constructed from validated dictionary
         File Modified: backend/server.py (lines 1624-1687)
         Status: Backend restarted successfully, fix is live
      
      2. ✅ TRANSACTIONS API - DEPENDENCY CLARIFIED
         Issue: "Requires valid account_id, but test account creation needed first"
         Analysis: This is not a bug but a test dependency requirement
         Clarification:
           - Transactions API is working correctly by design
           - It requires valid account_id for data integrity
           - The endpoint properly validates account existence
           - Returns clear error: "Account not found" if invalid account_id provided
         Testing Protocol:
           - Tests must create accounts FIRST before testing transactions
           - Use POST /api/accounts endpoint to create test accounts
           - Then use the returned account.id for transaction testing
         File: backend/server.py (line 3597-3625)
         Status: No code changes needed - API is functioning correctly
      
      📋 TESTING RECOMMENDATIONS:
      ================================================================================
      
      FOR PURCHASES API TESTING:
      1. Create a vendor party first (POST /api/parties with party_type="vendor")
      2. Create an account if testing with payments (POST /api/accounts)
      3. Test purchase creation with dictionary payload:
         ```json
         {
           "vendor_party_id": "{vendor_id}",
           "description": "Test Purchase",
           "weight_grams": 100.5,

      4. Verify purchase is created in draft status
      5. Test purchase finalization endpoint
      
      FOR TRANSACTIONS API TESTING:
      1. FIRST create test account:
         ```json
         {
           "name": "Test Cash Account",
           "account_type": "cash",
           "opening_balance": 1000.0
         }
         ```
      2. Get the account.id from response
      3. THEN create transaction with valid account_id:
         ```json
         {
           "account_id": "{account_id}",
           "transaction_type": "credit",
           "mode": "cash",
           "amount": 500.0,
           "category": "sales",
           "notes": "Test transaction"
         }
         ```
      4. Verify transaction is created and account balance is updated
      
      🎯 CHANGES SUMMARY:
      - Modified: 1 file (backend/server.py)
      - Changed: 1 endpoint (POST /api/purchases)
      - Backend Status: Restarted and running (PID 550)
      - Ready for Testing: YES
      
      ⚠️ NEXT STEPS:
      1. Test the fixed Purchases API with dictionary payload
      2. Test Transactions API with proper account setup
      3. Verify both APIs work end-to-end with frontend
      4. Update any frontend code that might be affected by the changes
