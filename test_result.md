# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

user_problem_statement: "Fix invoice print issues, complete daily closing, make all reports load correctly, add making-charge (flat/per-gram) and VAT options in create job card, and allow removing/editing items in new job cards. All changes must be backward-compatible. CRITICAL: Implement invoice state management (Draft/Finalized) to fix stock deduction logic - stock should ONLY be deducted when invoice is finalized, not on creation. ADDITIONAL: Implement job card locking with admin override and audit logging. NEW REQUIREMENT: Change stock deduction to directly reduce from inventory category quantities and weights instead of using separate dedication records. CURRENT REQUIREMENT: Implement walk-in vs saved customer handling with payment tracking - walk-in customers enter name/phone but are NOT saved in Parties, all payments create Transaction records."

Changes: (1) Added current_qty and current_weight fields to InventoryHeader model for direct stock tracking. (2) Modified POST /api/inventory/movements endpoint to DIRECTLY update header current values when movements are created, with validation to prevent negative stock. (3) Modified GET /api/inventory/stock-totals to return current values from headers instead of aggregating movements. (4) CRITICAL CHANGE in POST /api/invoices/{id}/finalize - Now DIRECTLY reduces current_qty and current_weight from inventory headers based on invoice item categories. Stock movements still created as audit trail. Validation added to prevent insufficient stock errors. (5) Added category field to InvoiceItem model to track which inventory category to reduce from. (6) Updated job card to invoice conversion to include category field. (7) Created migration script to initialize current stock values from existing movements. This ensures stock is reduced directly from categories instead of using separate dedication/movement records, while maintaining complete audit trail for compliance."

Changes: (1) Added invoice status badge column showing 'Draft' (blue) or 'Finalized' (green with lock icon). (2) Added 'Finalize' button for draft invoices with confirmation dialog explaining all consequences (stock deduction, invoice lock, job card lock, ledger entry creation). (3) Separated invoice status from payment status for clarity. (4) Added informational card explaining Draft vs Finalized workflow. (5) Button shows loading state while finalizing and is disabled during process. (6) Finalized invoices only show Print button, draft invoices show both Finalize and Print buttons. This completes the full invoice state management implementation - backend was correct but frontend lacked the UI to trigger finalization, meaning all invoices stayed in draft state forever with no stock deduction happening. Now users can properly finalize invoices through a clear, safe workflow. READY FOR TESTING - Need to verify: (a) Draft invoices display correctly with status badge, (b) Finalize button appears and works, (c) Confirmation dialog shows, (d) Status updates to Finalized after confirmation, (e) Finalize button disappears for finalized invoices, (f) Stock movements are created, (g) Job cards get locked, (h) Customer ledger entries are created."

(2) Added convertData state for customer type, customer selection, walk-in name/phone. (3) Created Convert Dialog with radio buttons for customer type selection. For 'Saved Customer': Shows party dropdown with existing customers, displays info about ledger tracking and outstanding. For 'Walk-in Customer': Shows name input (required) and phone input (optional), displays warning that walk-in customers are NOT saved in Parties and full payment is recommended. (4) Updated Convert to Invoice button to pass entire jobcard object instead of just ID. InvoicesPage changes: (1) Added payment dialog functionality with accounts loading. (2) Updated invoice table to show 'Walk-in' badge for walk-in customers with walk_in_name display. (3) Added 'Add Payment' button for all invoices with balance_due > 0. (4) Created payment dialog with: amount input (default to full balance), payment mode dropdown (Cash/Bank Transfer/Card/UPI/Online/Cheque), account selection (where money goes), notes field. Shows walk-in warning for partial payments. (5) handleAddPayment function calls POST /api/invoices/{id}/add-payment and shows warning toast for walk-in partial payments.

Root cause analysis: Backend implementation was 100% correct (draft→finalized logic, stock deduction on finalization, immutable finalized invoices). However, InvoicesPage.js had NO way for users to finalize invoices - no status display, no finalize button. Result: All invoices stayed in 'draft' status forever, stock was NEVER deducted. Fix implemented: (1) Added invoice status badges (Draft/Finalized with lock icon). (2) Added Finalize button with comprehensive confirmation dialog. (3) Separated invoice status from payment status columns for clarity. (4) Added info card explaining workflow. (5) Finalize button calls POST /api/invoices/{id}/finalize and reloads data. This completes the full invoice state management feature. Ready for UI testing to verify users can now finalize invoices and trigger stock deduction."

(2) Fixed backend server.py line 658-659 to handle None/0 weight values properly with safe defaults: weight = item.get('weight_out') or item.get('weight_in') or 0; weight = float(weight) if weight else 0.0.
